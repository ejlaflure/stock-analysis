# Stock Analysis Challenge
- In order to perform the stock analysis more efficently using VBA, the nested loop was replaced with two seperate loops and a tickerIndex variable. To seperate the loops, the data needed to be stored in seperate arrays during the first loop and then generated from those arrays in a second loop. Using this process insead of the nested loop not only stores the data in the arrays, instead of just generating it once it's collected, but it also maked the code far more efficent becasuse only 3,025 loops occur insead of 36,156. 
- The completed code can be found in the green_stocks (Module 2 Challenge) excel workbook.
